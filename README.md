# Health databases: Preprocessing and Descriptive

This repository presents information about the health databases from SSC (Health Secretary of Campinas - Secretaria de Sa√∫de de Campinas) used in our projects. The databases are for hospitalizations and deaths in the city of Campinas, SP. 

These databases were collected in the FAPESP project 17/20013-0, entitled "Human Health and Adaptation to Climate Change in Brazil: A Data Science Approach", with project at the Committee for Ethics in Research (CEP) under CAAE 95503318.4.0000.5404.

The datasets are no public due to ethical restrictions. However, we are working to make them anonymised and public...stay tuned.

## Preprocessing data

Both databases required data preprocessing and cleanning. These procedures are described in detail in Technical reports 01/2020 and 02/2020.
